    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import iterConstant from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/iter-constant@v0.2.2-deno/mod.js';
```

#### iterConstant( value\[, options] )

Returns an iterator which always returns the same value.

```javascript
var it = iterConstant( 3.14 );
// returns <Object>

var v = it.next().value;
// returns 3.14

v = it.next().value;
// returns 3.14

v = it.next().value;
// returns 3.14

// ...
```

The returned iterator protocol-compliant object has the following properties:

-   **next**: function which returns an iterator protocol-compliant object containing the next iterated value (if one exists) assigned to a `value` property and a `done` property having a `boolean` value indicating whether the iterator is finished.
-   **return**: function which closes an iterator and returns a single (optional) argument in an iterator protocol-compliant object.

The function supports the following `options`:

-   **iter**: number of iterations. Default: `1e308`.

By default, the function returns an infinite iterator (i.e., an iterator which never ends). To limit the number of iterations, set the `iter` option.

```javascript
var opts = {
    'iter': 2
};
var it = iterConstant( 3.14, opts );
// returns <Object>

var v = it.next().value;
// returns 3.14

v = it.next().value;
// returns 3.14

var bool = it.next().done;
// returns true
```

## Notes

-   When provided an `object` reference, the returned iterator always returns the same reference.

    ```javascript
    var arr = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];

    var it = iterConstant( arr );
    // returns <Object>

    var v1 = it.next().value;
    // returns [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

    var bool = ( v1 === arr );
    // returns true

    var v2 = it.next().value;
    // returns [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

    bool = ( v2 === arr );
    // returns true

    // ...
    ```

    To avoid unwanted `object` mutation, copy a provided `value` **before** creating an iterator.

-   If an environment supports `Symbol.iterator`, the returned iterator is iterable.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
import randu from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/random-base-randu@deno/mod.js';
import iterConstant from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/iter-constant@v0.2.2-deno/mod.js';

// Create an iterator:
var opts = {
    'iter': 10
};
var it = iterConstant( randu(), opts );

// Perform manual iteration...
var v;
while ( true ) {
    v = it.next();
    if ( v.done ) {
        break;
    }
    console.log( v.value );
}
